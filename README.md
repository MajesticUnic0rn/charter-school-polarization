# charter-school-polarization
Analysis of charter schools and the testing if local schools are silo-ing students into their respective affiliation. How heavy is the indoctrination based on website marketing/text, maybe images but that is hard as shit dude.

The charter school information is gather from EDDIE North Carolina Schools

What are the steps? 

1) From each email address - break down email address to domain website
2) From the school name google search "board members" 
3) Data Quality Check: Are the board members website same from the email domain website?
4) Scrape the board member website 
5) Find a Bert model that would do NER very well without bias (having a problem with ethnic/black names currently)
6) Break down names into first and last
7) search names closest to school zipcode and closest name to NC voter registration 


Analysis 
1) Scrape surface level of charter schools marketing campaign
2) ???
3) Profit
